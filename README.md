# Web APIs: Code Quiz

- Practice for a technical interview with some multiple-choice coding questions! Race against the 60 second timer and answer all of the questions. But beware, pressing the wrong answer will subtract 5 seconds off of the timer. At the end of the questions, the player is notified that their time is up, and then brought to a page to input their initials. Their score is then kept in local storage and displayed alongside their intials.
